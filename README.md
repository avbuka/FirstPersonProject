# FirstPersonProject
A project for learning Unreal and implementing all sorts of cool stuff. The main version control is Perforce.

## Details

### Movement 
#### Mantling
The character can mantle over high and low obstacles. Two distinct animations are played. Ledge detector component performs 3 checks (forward, top-down and overlap) to ensure we can mantle and only then we perform it.
